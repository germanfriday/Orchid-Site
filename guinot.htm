<h2>Guinot Paris at Orchid Day Spa</h2> 
<p>Founded in France over forty years ago by Rene Guinot, a well-known 
chemist, this collection of skincare products, now known throughout the world 
as Guinot Paris, began with a focused approach to treating the skin with the

as the Guinot professional treatments are available in a specially selected 
number of spas and salons throughout the U.S. and the world.</p>

categories - face, body and sun. In each category, the company's philosophy 
of professional expertise as a guide to product usage is an important part
